      "bot_response": "Thank you for sharing. Okay, Sriram, let's build a diet plan for you! Given your age, height, weight, and location in India, we'll focus on a balanced plan that supports your activity levels, potential growth, and dietary staples in India.\n\n**1. Addressing Potential Current Diet Issues (Assumed):**\n\nSince you haven't specified your current diet, let's assume some common potential issues for someone your age in India:\n\n*   **High Carbohydrate Intake:** Many Indian diets are rich in carbohydrates (rice, roti). While carbs are important, an excess can lead to weight gain if not balanced with protein and healthy fats.\n*   **Insufficient Protein:** Protein is crucial for muscle building and repair, especially at your age. Many vegetarian diets can be low in protein if not carefully planned.\n*   **Processed Foods:** The availability of processed foods (chips, sugary drinks, instant noodles) is increasing in India, and these can contribute to unhealthy fats, added sugars, and sodium.\n*   **Lack of Micronutrients:** Not enough fruits and vegetables can lead to deficiencies in vitamins and minerals.\n*   **Irregular Meal Timings:** Skipping meals or eating at inconsistent times can negatively impact metabolism and energy levels.\n\n**2. Healthy Alternatives & Principles:**\n\n*   **Focus on Whole Foods:** Prioritize minimally processed foods. Think fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.\n*   **Balance Macronutrients:** Aim for a balance of carbohydrates, protein, and fats in each meal.\n*   **Hydration is Key:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day, especially before, during, and after physical activity. Aim for at least 3 liters.\n*   **Mindful Eating:** Pay attention to hunger and fullness cues. Eat slowly and savor your food.\n*   **Prioritize Home-Cooked Meals:**  This gives you control over ingredients and portion sizes.\n*   **Include Variety:**  Don't be afraid to try new foods and recipes to keep your diet interesting and ensure you're getting a wide range of nutrients.\n\n**3. Balanced Meal Plan (Example):**\n\nThis is a sample plan. You might need to adjust portion sizes based on your activity level and individual needs. Remember to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.\n\n**Goal:** Aim for roughly 2500-3000 calories per day, depending on your activity level.\n\n**Meal 1: Breakfast (6:00 AM - 8:00 AM)**\n\n*   **Option 1 (Vegetarian):**\n    *   2-3 Whole Wheat Roti/Chapati\n    *   1 cup Vegetable Sabzi (e.g., Spinach, mixed vegetables) cooked with minimal oil\n    *   1 cup Curd/Yogurt (low fat)\n*   **Option 2 (Non-Vegetarian):**\n    *   Oats Porridge (1/2 cup dry oats) with nuts and seeds (almonds, walnuts, flax seeds)\n    *   2 Boiled Eggs\n*   **Alternative:**  Moong Dal Cheela with green chutney.\n\n**Meal 2: Mid-Morning Snack (10:00 AM - 11:00 AM)**\n\n*   **Option 1:** 1 Fruit (Apple, Banana, Orange) + handful of nuts (Almonds, Walnuts)\n*   **Option 2:** Sprouted Moong Salad with chopped vegetables (tomato, cucumber, onion) and lemon juice.\n*   **Alternative:**  A small bowl of homemade Greek yogurt (if available) or curd.\n\n**Meal 3: Lunch (1:00 PM - 2:00 PM)**\n\n*   **Option 1 (Vegetarian):**\n    *   1.5 cups Brown Rice/Quinoa\n    *   1 cup Dal (Lentil soup - e.g., Dal Makhani, Moong Dal)\n    *   1 cup Vegetable Sabzi (e.g., Cauliflower, Beans)\n    *   Small salad (cucumber, tomato, onion)\n*   **Option 2 (Non-Vegetarian):**\n    *   2-3 Whole Wheat Roti/Chapati\n    *   150g Grilled Chicken or Fish (prepared with minimal oil and spices)\n    *   1 cup Vegetable Sabzi\n    *   Small salad\n*   **Alternative:**  Rajma Chawal (Kidney Bean Curry with Rice).  Control portion sizes.\n\n**Meal 4: Evening Snack (4:00 PM - 5:00 PM)**\n\n*   **Option 1:**  Handful of roasted chickpeas/chana (without added salt and oil)\n*   **Option 2:**  Vegetable Soup (homemade, low sodium)\n*   **Option 3:**  Hard-boiled Egg\n*   **Alternative:**  A small serving of unsweetened popcorn.\n\n**Meal 5: Dinner (8:00 PM - 9:00 PM)**\n\n*   **Option 1 (Vegetarian):**\n    *   1 cup Vegetable Khichdi (made with brown rice and lentils)\n    *   1 cup Raita (Yogurt with vegetables)\n*   **Option 2 (Non-Vegetarian):**\n    *   2 Whole Wheat Roti/Chapati\n    *   150g Grilled/Baked Fish or Chicken Curry (prepared with minimal oil and spices)\n    *   Small salad\n*   **Alternative:**  Dalia (Broken Wheat) Upma with vegetables.\n\n**Before Bed (Optional):**\n\n*   A glass of warm milk (with a pinch of turmeric) or a small handful of almonds can promote better sleep.\n\n**4. Considerations for User Profile (Sriram - 19 years old, Male, Indian):**\n\n*   **Growth and Development:**  At 19, you're still developing, so adequate protein and micronutrients are vital.\n*   **Activity Level:**  This plan assumes a moderately active lifestyle. Adjust calorie intake based on your actual activity. If you're very active (sports, gym), you may need more calories and protein.\n*   **Indian Cuisine:** This plan incorporates common Indian dishes. You can adapt it to your favorite recipes, but be mindful of portion sizes and cooking methods (using less oil, avoiding excessive sugar and salt).\n*   **Cultural Preferences:**  If you're vegetarian, focus on incorporating diverse plant-based protein sources like lentils, beans, chickpeas, tofu, paneer (if you consume dairy), and soy products.\n*   **Accessibility:** This plan uses readily available ingredients in India.\n\n**Important Notes & Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Oil:** Use healthy oils like olive oil, groundnut oil, or rice bran oil in moderation.\n*   **Salt and Sugar:**  Reduce your intake of added salt and sugar.  Use spices to flavor your food.\n*   **Exercise:** Combine this diet plan with regular exercise (cardio and strength training) for optimal results. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week.\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** Pay attention to how different foods affect you and adjust your diet accordingly.\n*   **Gradual Changes:** Don't try to change everything at once. Start with small, sustainable changes and gradually build from there.\n*   **Tracking:** Use a food diary or app to track your calorie and macronutrient intake for a few days to get a better understanding of your eating habits.\n\n**Final Reminder:** This is a general diet plan. Please consult a registered dietitian or healthcare professional for personalized advice based on your individual health conditions, dietary needs, and goals. They can help you create a plan that is safe and effective for you. Good luck!\n\n\n*Your BMI: 24.7* - Great! Maintain your healthy weight."
